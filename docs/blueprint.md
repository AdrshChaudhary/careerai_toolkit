## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Saturated purple (#9D4EDD) to convey a sense of creativity, innovation, and forward-thinking.
- Background color: Dark purple (#1A132F), a desaturated and darkened tone of the primary color. This supports the dark theme requested by the user.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#59A5F4), which contrasts with the purple hues to draw attention to key elements, for example call to action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable interface.
- Use modern, minimalist icons from ShadCN UI components to maintain a consistent visual style.
- Collapsible sidebar layout for easy navigation and a clean, focused content area, similar to the user's linked project.
- Subtle transitions and animations for UI elements to provide a smooth and engaging user experience. E.g. sidebar collapse/expand animations and loading states for AI analysis.
